## 15. Legal Framework Focus: Evidence Act (Nigeria)

This study is grounded in the statutory framework governing evidence in Nigeria, particularly the **Evidence Act 2011 (as amended)**. While the Act regulates all aspects of admissibility and proof, this research will place special emphasis on two critical clusters of provisions that directly shape evidence management practices in modern trials:

1. **Sections 12–24** — Governing oral and documentary evidence, including rules on admissibility, authentication, and proof of documents.
2. **Sections 38–53** — Governing electronic and computer-generated evidence, including conditions for admissibility, certification requirements, and evidentiary presumptions.

These provisions are central to contemporary evidence management, especially in jurisdictions such as Maiduguri where documentary reliability, witness credibility, digital records, and forensic documentation increasingly determine trial outcomes.

## 16. Doctrinal Scope: Sections 12–24 (Oral & Documentary Evidence)

### 16.1 Normative Framework

Sections 12–24 of the Evidence Act regulate the admissibility and authentication of oral and documentary evidence, including:

- The primacy of **direct oral evidence** (s.12),
- Rules governing **documentary proof** (ss.13–16),
- Requirements for **primary and secondary evidence** (ss.17–20),
- Authentication of documents and public records (ss.21–24).

These provisions establish the foundational legal standards for proof, reliability, and authenticity of both testimonial and documentary materials in trial proceedings.

---

### 16.2 Practical Relevance to Evidence Management

In courtroom practice, compliance with Sections 12–24 determines:

- Whether documents are properly authenticated before admission,
- Whether oral testimony meets directness and competence standards,
- Whether secondary evidence is lawfully substituted for primary documents,
- Whether documentary exhibits are excluded due to procedural or technical defects.

However, empirical observations indicate frequent challenges in:

- Proper certification of public documents,
- Loss or deterioration of original exhibits,
- Poor documentation of chain of custody,
- Judicial inconsistency in applying authentication standards.

This study therefore seeks to empirically examine how courts in Maiduguri interpret, apply, and operationalize Sections 12–24 in real trial settings, and how institutional practices affect compliance with these statutory requirements.

## 17. Doctrinal Scope: Sections 38–53 (Electronic & Computer-Generated Evidence)

### 17.1 Normative Framework

Sections 38–53 of the Evidence Act establish Nigeria’s legal regime for **electronic evidence**, including:

- Admissibility of computer-generated documents (s.84),
- Conditions for authenticity and reliability of electronic records,
- Certification requirements for electronic evidence,
- Evidentiary presumptions concerning electronic communications and records.

These provisions reflect the modernization of evidence law in response to digital records, electronic transactions, forensic technologies, and computer-mediated communications.

---

### 17.2 Practical Relevance to Evidence Management

In contemporary litigation, especially criminal investigations, banking disputes, cybercrime cases, and terrorism-related prosecutions, electronic evidence increasingly forms the backbone of proof. However, courts continue to face challenges relating to:

- Compliance with **Section 84 certification requirements**,
- Authenticity of electronic documents,
- Digital chain-of-custody gaps,
- Forensic reliability of electronic records,
- Judicial uncertainty in evaluating metadata and technical reports.

Empirical studies and appellate decisions reveal that improper handling of electronic evidence remains one of the most common grounds for exclusion of probative material and reversal on appeal. This research will therefore critically examine how courts in Maiduguri manage electronic evidence in practice, the extent of compliance with statutory requirements, and the institutional capacity of courts and law enforcement agencies to meet digital evidentiary standards.

## 18. Doctrinal-Operational Research Interface

This research adopts a **doctrinal-operational framework**, examining not only the statutory rules contained in Sections 12–24 and 38–53 of the Evidence Act, but also how these provisions are operationalized through:

- Judicial rulings on admissibility,
- Courtroom practices of lawyers and registrars,
- Registry systems for exhibit handling,
- Institutional protocols for electronic evidence storage and authentication,
- Law enforcement documentation practices.

The study therefore bridges the gap between law-in-books and law-in-action, offering an empirically grounded assessment of evidentiary compliance and procedural effectiveness in real trial environments.

## 19. Doctrinal Research Questions

In addition to the broader research questions, this study specifically investigates:

1. How do courts in Maiduguri interpret and apply Sections 12–24 of the Evidence Act regarding oral and documentary evidence?
2. What practical challenges arise in authenticating documents and ensuring compliance with primary and secondary evidence rules?
3. How effectively are Sections 38–53 applied in the admission and evaluation of electronic and computer-generated evidence?
4. What institutional, technological, and procedural barriers hinder compliance with electronic evidence requirements?
5. How do evidentiary failures under these sections affect trial efficiency, appeal outcomes, and judicial credibility?

---

## 20. Empirical Indicators Linked to Sections 12–24

The study operationalizes Sections 12–24 through the following empirical indicators:

- Frequency of documentary evidence rejection due to authentication defects,
- Incidence of secondary evidence tendered in lieu of primary documents,
- Judicial reasoning patterns on documentary admissibility,
- Registry practices in exhibit labeling and document certification,
- Impact of documentary evidence defects on adjournments and trial duration.

---

## 21. Empirical Indicators Linked to Sections 38–53

Sections 38–53 are operationalized through:

- Rate of exclusion of electronic evidence due to non-compliance with Section 84 certification,
- Judicial consistency in applying electronic evidence standards,
- Availability and reliability of forensic and digital authentication tools,
- Registry capacity to store, retrieve, and protect electronic exhibits,
- Impact of digital evidence defects on appeals and reversals.

---

## 22. Policy & Reform Relevance

By grounding analysis in Sections 12–24 and 38–53 of the Evidence Act, this research directly supports:

- Judicial training programs on evidence law,
- Reform of court registry and exhibit management systems,
- Development of standardized electronic evidence protocols,
- Strengthening of forensic and digital evidence handling capacity,
- Procedural reforms to reduce evidentiary error and trial delays.

This ensures that the research outputs are immediately usable by courts, judicial policymakers, and law reform institutions.

---

## 23. Anticipated Contributions to Law & Practice

This study will:

- Provide the first systematic empirical analysis of the application of Sections 12–24 and 38–53 in Northern Nigerian courts.
- Generate judicially actionable recommendations for documentary and electronic evidence management.
- Support harmonization of trial practice with statutory standards.
- Enhance evidentiary reliability in complex criminal and civil litigation.
- Contribute to Nigerian evidence law scholarship and judicial reform discourse.

---

## 24. Conclusion: Doctrinal Centrality of Evidence Management

Evidence management is not merely administrative but doctrinally foundational to justice delivery. Sections 12–24 and 38–53 of the Evidence Act constitute the core statutory architecture governing authenticity, reliability, and admissibility of proof in Nigerian trials. This research situates these provisions at the center of empirical inquiry, ensuring that reform proposals are not abstract but legally grounded, institutionally feasible, and operationally impactful.
